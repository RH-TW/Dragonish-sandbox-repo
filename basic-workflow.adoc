// the most minimalist workflow possible, with concepts for each step.

== VERY basic workflows
This topic provides the basic commands that you need to use.. for the concepts and further explanation behind each command, refer to link:workflow-with-concepts.adoc[Workflow with concepts].

=== First time around

fork +
clone +
define your upstream +
define your origin (??) +
run 'git remote -v' to verify +
git fetch upstream +
git merge upstream/master OR is this git rebase?? +
git push origin master (you might have to define your branch in your origin with ' git push --set-upstream origin master') +
-then do a test edit +
git add +
git commit +
git push +
create a PR (from either upstream GUI or your forked repo GUI) +

=== Subsequent work/edits:

git fetch +
git rebase +
git push +
-then do my edits +
git add +
git commit +
git push +

=== Important tips and tricks

Use the 'tab' key to auto-complete your file name! +
Use the Up and Down arrows to scroll through previous commands +
